- 👋 Hi, I’m @psanden-Alexandria
- 👀 I’m interested in learning better/faster ways to code (RPG / CL / DDS / SQL in IBMi env and some RDI experience)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning what github is, and looking for ways to list & concat long IFS filenames into 1 file (daily).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on (I am too new to github to be helpful)
- 📫 How to reach me ...
